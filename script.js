      Hey there!<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp Well, look at you… today marks the end of one incredible chapter, and the beginning of another even more exciting one. I couldn’t be more proud of you. Watching you work so hard, pushing through every challenge, and staying focused no matter what life threw your way—it’s been nothing short of inspiring. Your strength, your passion, your resilience… it all paid off. And now, you stand tall as a living testament to dedication and perseverance.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbspYou’ve always had this quiet fire in you—the kind that doesn’t need to shout to be felt. The way you chase your goals, how you keep your heart in everything you do, and how you make even the hardest things seem effortless—it’s something I deeply admire. You’ve achieved something so special, and I hope you truly take this moment in. This isn’t just a piece of paper or a certificate. It’s a reflection of who you are: someone incredibly talented, courageous, and full of light.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbspAnd beyond all the accomplishments, it’s who you are as a person that I’m most grateful for. You’ve shared your journey with so much grace and kindness, and I feel incredibly lucky to have witnessed your growth. You’ve touched hearts, including mine, just by being you. Your ability to uplift, inspire, and make others believe in themselves is something rare—and something I’ll never stop appreciating.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbspThank you for allowing me to walk beside you on this journey. No matter where life takes you next, I know you’ll continue to shine in your own beautiful way. The world better be ready, because this is just the beginning. And no matter what, I’ll always be right here—cheering you on, proud of every step you take.
    <br><br>
    Congratulations, Pen 🦢.<br>
    You’ve earned every bit of this moment. Don’t ever forget how amazing you are.
    <br><br>
    With all my love, admiration, and appreciation,<br>
    – Cob
    <br><br>
    You will have the life, you always talk about.

      You don’t owe me anything—not closure, not answers, not even a glance back.<br>  
      Just knowing you’re out there, hopefully healing and becoming everything you’re meant to be—that’s enough for me. <br> 
      I may never get to be part of your next chapters, and that’s okay.  <br>
      Because a part of me will always quietly root for you from afar.  <br>
      Every dream you chase, every laugh you share, every moment of peace you find—I’ll be silently cheering for it all.<br>  
      You’ve taught me what real love feels like—not just the joy, but the responsibility and the letting go, too.  <br>
      And while it hurts to hold back everything I still feel, I’ll carry it with grace.  <br>
      Not as a regret, but as a reminder of something real, something pure.  <br>
      Loving you shaped me. It made me softer. Braver. Wiser.  <br>
      So if this love has to live quietly in me from now on, so be it.  <br>
      It will live as something beautiful—not bitter.  <br>
      And if ever you feel alone, I hope a part of your heart remembers...  <br>
      There’s someone out here who still carries you with gentleness, always.  <br>
    <br><br>
      And if I’m being honest...  <br>
      I want you to know that no matter where life takes you from here—my hope for you is peace.  <br>
      A peace so quiet and warm it wraps around you like a gentle morning light.  <br>
      I hope you find everything you’ve been searching for, even the things you didn’t know you needed.  <br>
      I hope love surrounds you in the way you deserve—fully, honestly, and without fear.  <br>
      And if ever my absence creates silence, I hope it’s the kind that lets you breathe easier.  <br>
    <br><br>
      As for me, this will always be my quiet burden to carry.  <br>
      Not a painful one—but a precious one.  <br>
      Because it’s been a privilege to love you.  <br>
      And an even greater honor to have been loved by someone like you.  <br>
      So if this is goodbye, let it be gentle. Let it be kind.  <br>
      And please—walk forward with your head high and your heart full.  <br>

    &nbsp These past few days, you've been asking me why I left—why I would even think of walking away from you. And I’ve told you, more than once, that I didn’t want to. I never intended to leave you. And that’s the truth.
  <br><br>
  Still, I realize maybe it wasn’t about hearing the words—you needed to feel that I meant them. So I’m writing this, even though part of me is hesitant. Maybe I’ve already said enough. Maybe you've already heard everything you needed. But there’s still something in me that needs to be said.
  <br><br>
  I'm sorry, Julia. Truly.
  <br><br>
  I didn’t leave because I stopped loving you.<br>
  I didn’t leave because I hated you.<br>
  I didn’t leave because I wanted to.<br><br>
  
  I left because I felt something I’ve never felt toward you before—feelings that I always hate having, feeling that I always avoid to feel on someone and to anyone.<br><br>
  
  I was angry. I was mad. And I didn’t want that version of me anywhere near you, that's what I promised you, and that's what I promised myself.<br><br>
  
  I admitted I was angry, but I couldn’t even explain it fully at the time. I didn’t want to speak out of that anger and say things I didn’t mean. I didn’t want to let my emotions take control and end up hurting you with my words or actions. I know you've been through so much already—I couldn’t bear the thought of adding more weight to that, all I ever want for you is your peace and happiness.
  <br><br>
  So, I stepped away. Not because I wanted to abandon you. Not because I want to avoid all the accountability, but because I wanted to protect you—from me, in that moment. I needed to cool down, to collect myself, to come back as someone who could love you properly, not someone led by frustration and fear.
  <br><br>
  > while writing this— I wish I had told you all this instead of what I did say—that you deserved better, that I always mess things up. I said those things because I was overwhelmed, not because they were true. And I’m sorry for that too.
  <br><br>
  > so in the middle of writing this what I’ve come to realize is that sometimes, all I needed was just to breathe—to have a pause and inhale-exhale things out instead of just letting my self out and explode. And I’m glad I did. Because now I can speak to you clearly, calmly, and honestly.
  <br><br>
  I love you, Julia. And I’m here—not to run, not to leave—but to make things right.
  <br><br>
  I am so hesitant to send this to you because I promised you and also written on the letters I gave you that, that would be the last apologize letter you will receive from me because I'm going to be better and more better for you — but as you can see I still couldn't. I want to be a man of my word but as you can see, I failed.
  <br><br>
